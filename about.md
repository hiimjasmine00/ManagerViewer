# Manager Viewer
A mod that allows viewing of the addresses of manager classes.

# About Manager Classes
In the context of this mod, Geometry Dash, and Cocos2d-x, a manager class is a singleton (a class that only has one instance) that is used to manage a certain aspect of the game. For example, the `GameManager` class is used to manage the game state, and the `CCDirector` class is used to manage the game's display.

# Features
- A popup that displays the addresses of manager classes in the game, which can be toggled through a button in the main menu or by using a hotkey.
- A customizable hotkey for toggling the popup, which can be set in the settings of the mod "Custom Keybinds" by Geode Team. (Windows and Android only)
